<h2>Project Description and Context</h2>
<p><img style="float:right" src="images/BLBW.jpg" /></p>
<p>We are working here with the same dataset described in the Ovenbird demo exercise. The data were provided by Mike Hallworth, and collected at Hubbard Brook New Hampshire, USA. The full data set at Hubbard Brook had 373 point count survey locations systematically placed throughout Hubbard Brook Valley along 15 transects. Our data set includes 296 of these survey points. Point counts were conducted 4 times per year, and have been collected since 1999. Here we are working with a single year’s data. Surveys typically started at the end of May, and all 4 surveys were typically done within a month. Each point count was split into 3 consecutive “periods” of 3 minutes, 20 seconds each (so the observer spent 10 minutes at each location during a survey). These data are part of a large, long-term study focused on investigating many aspects of songbird ecology including habitat use, recruitment, species richness and abundance, and many others. In this demo we’ll be working only with the Blackburnian Warbler (BLBW). Here our goal is to assess what factors influence occupancy probability of blackburnian warblers in this landscape, while accounting for factors that may influence detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercise-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue to practice with importing and formating raw data from point count field studies for occupancy analysis</li>
<li>Practice functions in the package <code>unmarked</code> for single-season occupancy analysis</li>
<li>Independently run a single season occupancy modeling analysis with covariates on both occupancy and detection probability</li>
<li>Independently interpret output results of occupancy models and use model selection approaches to address competing ecological hypotheses</li>
<li>Create response curves for model covariates to assist in model interpretation</li>
</ul>
<div id="librariessetup" class="section level3">
<h3>Libraries/Setup</h3>
<p>Let’s first call the packages we’ll need in this exercise. Use <code>install.packages</code> if you do not have these packages already on your machine.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(unmarked)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate) #for the `yday` function</code></pre>
<p>
<p>Remember also when starting a new analysis to clear your environment. This is generally always a good idea, particularly in cases where you might be using models of the same names as previous analyses.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rm(list = ls())</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="data-import-and-exploration" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Import and Exploration</h3>
<p>
<p>We can bring in data using our <code>read.csv</code> command, with our data files stored in our course dropbox folder as opposed to on our local computer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>counts &lt;- 
  read.csv(&#39;https://www.dropbox.com/s/fdotemoww8qdu8l/countData.csv?dl=1&#39;)

visits &lt;-

</div>
<div id="data-formatting" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Formatting</h3>
<p>Since we are using the same data set from the ovenbird demonstration, we need to perform the same formatting steps to prepare the data for analysis.</p>
<p>
Step1: Using the ovenbird demo as a guide, first pull out only the Blackburnian warbler observation from the <code>counts</code> object, select out the <code>plot</code> and <code>replicate</code> columns, and create a new column for counts (<code>n</code>) that is set to 1. Remember to keep only unique rows, since we sometimes have more than one observation within a 10 minute period. Review your new counts object to make sure everything worked properly.
<p>
<strong>Q1: How many observations of Blackburnian Warblers were recorded?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<p>Step 2: Create a detection frame for these counts, being sure to account for visits where no observations were recorded. This requires use of the <code>visits</code> object. View your detection frame to make sure everything worked properly.</p>
<p>
<p>Step3: Our last step in data formatting will be to create a list of our survey covariates. These are stored in the <code>visits</code> object. But now each separate covariates needs to exist in its own data frame within a list. Each data frame should have 296 rows (for each site) and 4 columns (for each ocassion). This code should be the same as in the ovenbird demo, since these covariates are not specific to the species we are analyzing.</p>
<p>
Our data are now ready for the <code>unmarkedFrameOccu</code> function which prepares our data for occupancy analysis.We need to provide three objects, the detection matrix, our site covariates data frame, and a list of dataframes for our observation/survey covariates.
<p>
Step4: Create an unmarked frame for use in our occupancy models and use <code>summary</code> to review
<p>
<p><strong>Q2: What is our naive occupancy probability for this species?</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="model-fitting-and-model-selection---occupancy-and-detection-covariates" class="section level3">
<h3>Model Fitting and Model Selection - Occupancy and Detection Covariates</h3>
<p>
We now are ready to run some single-season occupancy models. Remember that it is best practice to first test a range of models that investigate potential hypotheses for what covariates are impacting occupancy, while using a fully general model for detection probability. Once you refine your occupancy variables you can then refine/simplify your detection covariates if possible. Use the ovenbird demo exercise as a guide. Here again, as in the ovenbird demo, you may need to use starting values if some models fail to run.
<p>
Step 5: Conduct a complete model selection and comparison work flow to arrive at a best final model describing occupancy/detection of this species.
<p>
<strong>Q3: Which covariates are important in determing probability of occupancy of this species?</strong>
<p>
<p><strong>Q4: What are the most important covariates in determining detection probability of this species?</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="model-interpretation-and-value-prediction" class="section level3">
<h3>Model Interpretation and Value Prediction</h3>
<p>
Step6: Now that you have identified your best model, use the <code>summary</code> function to review the details of the results. Remember that you can look at just the coefficients with the <code>coef</code> function as well.
<p>
<strong>Q5: Review the coefficient values of your parameters. Describe the relationship between each parameter and its response variable (i.e. occupancy or detection).</strong>
<p>
Step7: Use the <code>predict</code> function to look at estimated probabilities of detection and occupancy based on our actual site data. Use the <code>summary</code> function to look at the ranges of values that are predicted for the sites.
<p>
<strong>Q6: What are the average, min and max predicted values of occupancy across our sites? How does this compare to naive occupancy?</strong>
<p>
<strong>Q7: What is our average detection probability across our sites and how does this compare to our value for ovenbird detection probability?</strong>
<p>
<p><strong>Q8: With this average detection probability, what is the probability of not detecting this species at a site at least once (i.e. missing it 4 times in a row) if it was actually present?</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="graphical-interpretation-of-model-covariates" class="section level3">
<h3>Graphical Interpretation of Model Covariates</h3>
<p>
Let’s now take a graphical look at how our covariates influence occupancy and detection.
<p>
Step7: Use the <code>predict</code> function to predict values for detection probability, over a range of values for each important covariates. Use these predicted values to create response curves for detection covariates, and occupacy covariates. If observer is an important factor in the deteciton model, have each graph of any other detection covariates show a separate line for each observer.
<p>
<em>Hint: If something like time of day, or day of year are important, you’ll need to figure out how to set mean or median values of these covariates (which are stored as times or dates in <code>visits</code>). Check back for code in the ovenbird demo that shows how we converted them to numeric values.</em>
<p>
<p>STEP8: Now look at how our covariates influence blackburnian occupancy. As above we need to first create a new dataframe. Create a graph representing the relationship between each of your significant occupancy covariates, and probability of occupancy.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-conclusions" class="section level3">
<h3>Final Conclusions</h3>
<p>
Our ultimate goal in this analysis was to investigate the factors influencing occupancy of Blackburnian Warblers across the Hubbard Brook valley. To do this in the most robust way, we also wanted to account for imperfect detection, and we included a range of covariates to further assist us in accounting for those factors that may cause detection probability to vary across sites or site visits.
<p>
<strong>Q9: Describe in a few sentences what we have learned about Blackburnian Warblers in this landscape, with respect to both how they are detected and what influences their occupancy. </strong>
<p>
<strong>Q10: Let’s assume the Blackburnian Warbler was endangered. Think about how a manager might use this information from this analysis to better manage this population.</strong>
<p>
<p><strong>Q11: This analysis was simplified for this exercise, particularly with respect to the small number of covariates on occupancy. What other covariates might be interesting to test in this situation?</strong></p>
