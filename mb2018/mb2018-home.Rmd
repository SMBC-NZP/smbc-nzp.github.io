<h2>Getting started</h2>
<hr>
<p>R has become the universal quantitative interface for ecologists - it's free, powerful, flexible enough to do everything but write manuscripts for you, and is relatively user-friendly. We ask that, regardless of your current level of R knowledge, you please complete the following preliminary exercises prior to attending the course:<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Introduction to R Studio</b>. This lesson will provide new R users with the baseline knowledge necessary to use R and R Studio and align experienced R users with some of the terminology and best management practices used throughout this course.
</li>

<li><a href = "https://smbc-nzp.github.io/mb2018-L0-intro_RStudio">Lesson instructions</a></li>
</ul>
<li><b>Introduction to R, lesson 1: Values</b>. This lesson will instruct R users on the different classes of values that they will interact with in R.
