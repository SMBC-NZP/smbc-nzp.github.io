## Introduction to Archival light-level geolocators  

<p>The following document outlines the steps for analyzing data from archival light-level geolocators (hereafter geolocators). Geolocators have been used to track individuals since the early 1990s but were restricted to large organisms because of their large size. Recently, with the miniturization of geolocators, researchers are now able to deploy geolocators on smaller and smaller species.  Geolocators are devices that record ambient light levels every 2, 5, or 10 min depending on the model. Geolocators are attached to individuals which then migrate with the device while it records ambient light-levels throughout the year. Once recovered, the data are downloaded and analyzed to determine the time of sunrise and sunset. From the sunrise/sunset data the time of relative noon and midnight are determine. Geographical cooridnates are then derived from the relative 'noon' and 'midnight' times to give an approximate location of where the individual was throughout the year.</p>

<p>This tutorial uses geolocator data from a male Ovenbird (*Seiurus aurocapilla*) breeding at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH and a Wood Thrush (*Hylocichla mustelina*) breeding in Indiana and is part of an ongoing study modeling regional source-sink dynamics of a migratory songbird. Click [here](http://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/migratorybirds/research/marra/wood-thrush.cfm) for more information regarding the Wood Thrush project. The geolocators used for the two projects were purchased from [British Antarctic Survey](http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/bas_research/instruments/instrument7.php) (BAS) and [Lotek](htt://www.lotek.com/archival-birds.html) (LightBug). These models operate in the same manner but format the data differently. In order to use `GeoLight` to analyze the data, the data needed to be formatted correctly so `GeoLight` can read the data.</p>
