<h2 style = "text-align: center;">Course Announcement:</br>The Ecology and Conservation of Migratory Birds</h2>
<hr>
<p>Hi Folks,</p>


<p>The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center and Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation are pleased to announce that we will be conducting our course " <a href = "https://smconservation.gmu.edu/programs/graduate-and-professional/professional-training-courses/species-monitoring-and-conservation-bird-migration/"> <b>The Ecology and Conservation of Migratory Birds</b></a>" during the peak of 2018's fall migration (September 17-28, 2018). <img style="float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px; width: 450px;" src="moltPic.jpg"/>This two week course in the foothills of the Shenandoah Mountains emphasizes emerging technologies and tools for advancing ornithological science. The course is unique in the depth and breadth of the material covered. Participants leave having been immersed in the theory and practice of modern ornithology. We also take full advantage of the Smithsonian's location in the Nation's capitol, with guest lectures by ornithological professionals ranging from top scientists in the field to policy makers. </p>

<p><b>Who will benefit from this course</b>: This course is targeted towards graduate students from all over the world and professionals looking to learn new techniques. Participants will gain skills ranging from advanced R programming, to evaluating molt, to tracking birds with radio transmitters. The course has been described by one of our former students as "two years of graduate school in two weeks" -- we truly fill every student's mind to the brim. 

<p>This course is not about making a profit. It is about advancing critical knowledge to the next generation of ornithologists.</p>

<h3><b>Please help us promote ornithology and conserve migratory species by</b>:</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Circulating the <a href = "https://smconservation.gmu.edu/programs/graduate-and-professional/professional-training-courses/species-monitoring-and-conservation-bird-migration/"><b>course description/registration link</b></a> across your networks</b>: We want to get the course description out far and wide. We want to make sure that every student or professional out there whose research would benefit from taking this course hears about it. Please act quickly, this popular course generally receives roughly 75 applications for just 15 slots.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Sponsoring a student or two from your professional society</b>: Each time the course is offered we raise funds to offer several scholarships -- primarily for students from less developed countries. This year funding may be in jeopardy. Sponsoring students is an inexpensive activity and is a great way for a professional society to engage in with its members. The total cost for this course is $2925.50 (Course fee of $2100 + Housing and Dining Package of $825.50). Those applying as citizens of "less-developed" nations qualify for a reduced course fee of $1200, making the total cost including housing (shared double room) and dining package $2025.50.</li>
</ul>
