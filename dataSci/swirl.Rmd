The R community has created a number of interactive learning exercises that will help you get your R skills up to speed for this course. Regardless of your skill level, you will undoubtedly be able to learn a considerable amount from these courses. 

### Before you begin: 

1. If you do not yet have a current version R on your computer, download and install Program R ([link](https://cran.r-project.org/)).
2. Download and install R Studio onto your computer ([link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)).

### Install SWIRL:

Open R Studio.

SWIRL is essentially a user-generated program (also called a **package** or **library**) for use in R. To access this, you must first install the program. In the Console panel (bottom left), type or copy-and-paste the following and press Enter:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")

library(swirl)
```
_Note: You may be prompted to select a "mirror" from which to download the package. If this is the case, it is recommended that you choose the mirror that is geographically closest to you._


### SWIRL Lessons:

To best prepare you for this course, we ask that you complete lessons 1 through 8 of the R Programming SWIRL course. Begin by typing `swirl()` in your console. When prompted, select "R Programming: The basics of programming in R" (selection 1) and "R programming" (selection 1) in the following menu (if applicable). Select the appropriate lesson from the list of options to continue.  

Have fun!
